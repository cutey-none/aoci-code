# Changelog

All notable public changes to AOCI-CODE will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

Two contributor changes, both invisible to existing indexes: repository
snapshots hash their files concurrently with byte-identical output, and a root
that is not itself a Git repository now indexes each nested repository through
that repository's own Git authority. No index format, JSON field, CLI or MCP
schema, or Baseline identity changes, and a single-repository root or a plain
directory takes exactly the code paths it took before.

- Hash repository snapshots in parallel. A snapshot hashed every managed
  candidate on one goroutine, so about half of that pass sat in serial
  `open`/`read`/`close` syscalls. Candidates now go to `GOMAXPROCS` workers and
  their results come back in path order, which keeps the fingerprint map, the
  per-file warning text and order, and every failure path identical to the
  serial pass. Measured on a 1,302-file checkout: 487 ms to 221 ms, and `aoci
  scan` in a copy of this repository (1,208 files) reports 757 ms to 336 ms.
- Index workspaces whose repositories are nested. A directory that is not a Git
  repository fell back to name-only traversal, so a file hidden by
  `repoA/.gitignore` was inventoried exactly like the file beside it that
  `repoA` tracks, and Git-ignored build output entered the Baseline. Such a
  root now takes each nested repository's tracked, non-ignored untracked, and
  ignored paths, prefixed by that repository's directory, and only paths
  outside every repository keep the older traversal; a nested `.git` boundary
  Git cannot confirm fails closed. Measured on a six-repository workspace of
  3,372 files: 1,513 ms and 3,372 files to 195 ms and 372 files.

## v0.1.0-rc14

One format-level fix: directory and file names the index grammar could not
spell (#58, #60, #48), which wedged any repository with a spaced directory or a
bracketed dynamic-route file. Plus three contributor changes: tool schemas that
Gemini-style function declarations accept (#63), per-repository status
snapshots (#64), and a native build suffix (#65). Existing indexes are not
rewritten, every machine-written index that aligned under v0.1.0-rc13 aligns
here, and the nine tools accept the same inputs. v0.1.0-rc13 still reads an
index this release creates, but not the new names themselves, so a repository
that uses one needs this release or newer on every host.

- Spell directory and file names the index grammar could not (#58, #60, #48).
  The directory path in a section header stopped at the first whitespace, `=`,
  `(`, or `（`, and a file name could not hold `[`. Three things followed. A
  repository under a root with a space wrote that root in full once and then
  appended every later section under the truncated root the parser read back. A
  directory with a space made its Entry resolve to a path that does not exist,
  so the same file was reported orphan and missing and the repository could
  never align. And a file such as `pages/docs/[...id].jsx`, the dynamic-route
  form of Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit, could not be written at all, which
  failed its whole atomic batch on every attempt. The original readings stay
  first: an Entry line that parsed before parses identically, and a directory
  header changes only when its remainder ends in `/`, which is how a
  machine-written header for such a directory looks. A machine-written header
  is now read to its final `/`, a bracketed file name up to the tag that
  precedes `: F:`, and the dictionary, E-scale, S-quota, name-normalization,
  and migration consumers locate the tag through that same reading instead of
  the first `[`. Names are stored as they are, never escaped. An index already
  written with a truncated root keeps resolving in place and in a checkout at
  another path, without a rewrite, and a repository wedged by a directory name
  with a space reads as aligned on upgrade; every machine-written index that
  aligned under v0.1.0-rc13 aligns under this release. The origin and every
  checkout read the shape every release has written under such a root (the root
  section in full, later sections under the root as the original reading reads
  it back) the same way, because it is recognised from the text alone, before
  the runtime root is consulted: the first directory section reads as the
  common prefix under the original reading, whether the full root lies beside
  that prefix or, when the character begins a path segment (`/w/(x)/repo`),
  under it. This release writes that same shape, so one shape exists in the
  wild and v0.1.0-rc13 still reads an index created here. A new index now
  begins with its root section (written empty ahead of a first Entry that lives
  in a directory) and an empty section is kept while every other section lies
  below it, because it anchors relocation. Where an older writer spelled a
  directory in its first section (a dot-directory that sorted before every root
  file, or a directory whose first segment begins with `(`, such as a top-level
  `(home)/` under a clean root), that section keeps the old reading everywhere,
  so both sides report the same orphans and the ordinary repair aligns both;
  the same file name under it and under the section the repair adds is no
  longer taken for a duplicate, which refused every later write to such an
  index. A directory whose header would not read back to the same path (a
  segment that begins or ends with whitespace), or whose section would resolve
  somewhere else, is refused instead of being recorded there: `aoci_maintain`
  withholds the batch and answers `stopped` with `stop` facts that quote the
  directory and give the operator's way out, and `aoci_update_entry` gives the
  same answer to a caller that submits anyway, with a
  `code_directory_unspellable` finding and no retry scope, because no Entry
  edit clears it. A repository root that no header can carry (its first segment
  begins with `(`, `（`, or `=`, or a segment has edge whitespace) is not
  refused: the index records the part of it a header reads back, as every
  earlier release effectively did; only a root with no such part (a repository
  directly under `/` or a drive root whose name begins with one of those
  characters or with whitespace) is stopped, as `code_root_unspellable`. File
  and directory scope patterns accept `[`, so a dynamic route can be named in a
  rule, and a refused rule pattern now says why. v0.1.0-rc13 and earlier cannot
  read the new names themselves (they refuse an index holding a bracketed file
  name and resolve such a directory somewhere else), so a repository that uses
  one needs this release or newer on every host (`docs/upgrading.md`). The rule
  is in `spec/public/aoci-index-format-v1.txt`. Unit tests cover the readings,
  the healing, relocation before and after an insert, roots that cut at a
  segment boundary or cannot be spelled, and the root anchor; MCP tests walk
  authoring, healing, the directory-first index, relocated checkouts, and the
  withheld batch through to the rename that clears it; black-box scenario P1
  authors all four kinds under a root with a space and verifies a copy at
  another path, and P2 walks the withheld batch, the refused direct update, and
  the rename on the shipped binary (59 scenarios); and the upgrade axis gains
  two repository shapes, under a path with a space and under a directory whose
  name begins with `(`, plus a check that what the binary under test authors
  keeps a checkout aligned (32 checks per released version, over four shapes).
- Declare nullable tool inputs without JSON Schema type arrays (#61, #63). Five
  inputs across `aoci_get_entries`, `aoci_update_entry`, and `aoci_overview`
  used `"type": ["null", ...]`, which Gemini's function-declaration endpoint
  refuses, so a host forwarding the MCP schemas there could not register the
  tools at all. They are now `anyOf` with an explicit null branch. The accepted
  instances are identical; the published schema bytes change, and the golden
  moves with them. Checked against a live endpoint: the rc13 declarations
  answer HTTP 400 on gemini-3.8-flash and gemini-2.5-flash, these answer 200.
- Build status-page snapshots for different repositories concurrently (#64).
  One global mutex was held while a snapshot was built, so a slow repository
  blocked every other one; each root now has its own lock.
- Give `make build` the native executable suffix (#59, #65). Windows gets
  `build/aoci.exe` directly, `make verify` uses the same path, and the README
  drops the copy step. Linux and macOS are unchanged.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc14 is 2026-09-19.

## v0.1.0-rc13

One fix for a path that stayed closed after a cognition optimization (#57),
three status-page fixes from the contributor who found the rc10 and rc11
ones (#49, #51, #52), one harness improvement (#53), and one documentation
addition. Nothing in the nine-tool surface or any governance identity
changes.

- Keep the direct update path open after a cognition optimization. The
  update classifier counted an item as part of the current optimization
  batch when its batch id equalled the checkpoint's current or
  last-completed batch id, and one of those two is empty while the first
  batch is pending, between two batches, and after the optimization
  completes, when the checkpoint stays on disk for good. An item without a
  batch id, which is the documented compatibility path for a Code source
  and for an existing Database object, matched the empty id and was refused
  as `cognition_optimization_batch_mixed` with zero writes; Maintain-issued
  batches carry ids and never saw it. Present since the feature shipped
  (v0.1.0-rc3). A batch-less item now never counts as an optimization
  item, so it takes the ordinary path; three regression tests cover the
  three windows, and black-box scenario O1 walks the sequence on the
  shipped binary. (#57)
- Serve raw Volumes from the cached snapshot on the status page. `/api/raw`
  reopened the Code and Database Volume paths on every request while
  `/api/state` reused a two-second snapshot, so a Volume replaced with the
  same size and modification time let the two routes describe different
  bytes, with a validate-then-open window in between. The snapshot keeps the
  bytes the loader validated and the raw route serves those. (#49)
- List only the current user's servers in Linux discovery. The `/proc` scan
  parsed every process's command line without checking ownership, so another
  user's `aoci mcp` could appear on the status page with its repository path.
  Each process directory's owner is now compared with the effective UID
  before its command line is read. (#51)
- Reject an unexpected `Host` on the status page. Any `Host` value was
  accepted, so a browser reaching the loopback page through DNS rebinding
  could read responses carrying absolute repository paths. Every request is
  bound to the listener's exact address; the URL `aoci ui` prints is built
  from that address and keeps working, and on port 80 the form browsers send
  without the port is accepted as well. (#52)
- Keep the server's stderr tail when a black-box RPC times out. The three
  harness clients drained stderr continuously but their timeout error
  dropped the bounded tail. Test infrastructure only. (#53)
- Record the Codex host prerequisites. `docs/agent-integrations.md` gains
  the settings an unattended run through Codex 0.149 had to make before AOCI
  could be used: the Responses API for custom providers, the approval mode
  and standard-input redirection for headless `codex exec`, and the
  per-model tool-result ceiling, which is met by raising it in
  `model_catalog_json` or by lowering the team `overview_delivery.chunk_tokens`
  (floor 4000) beneath it.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc13 is 2026-09-17.

## v0.1.0-rc12

Seven fixes for repositories governed without a human in the loop, surfaced by
the first agent that drives the MCP end to end (aoci-agent) and by a
contributor governing a Volumes repository on Windows (#46, #47), plus one
test-only guard for the driver audit table. Two fixes close a Volumes v1
deadlock in the Managed Scope transaction; five correct counts, warnings, and
refusals. Each fix carries a test that fails without it, and the real-repository
harness now walks the deadlock path itself (56 scenarios and a new lifecycle
governance walk). Nothing in the nine-tool surface or any governance identity
changes.

- Let a Volumes v1 repository with a changed source activate a policy change.
  A policy edit (a scope rule, a budget) makes desired differ from active, and
  every authoring path refuses to write until one governed Apply activates it.
  That Apply refused to plan while any index-role source had changed since the
  Baseline (`managed_scope_index_source_stale`), and the Entry candidate that
  clears the block under Legacy was projected into the Root manifest under
  Volumes, where `aoci.txt` holds no Entries. A repository with one changed
  file and one pending rule had no legal move (#47). A policy-only Scope
  Change now plans over a changed source in Volumes: the postimage Baseline
  keeps the fingerprint the Entry was bound to, the plan reports the path
  under `source_stale_retained`, and the next `aoci_maintain` plans the source
  as it always did. A Volumes candidate set that carries `entries`,
  `dispositions`, or a `header` is refused before projection with
  `managed_scope_volumes_entry_candidates_unsupported`. Legacy keeps failing
  closed, and a plan without retention serializes as before, so no in-flight
  `plan_id` changes.
- Name the field in a refused candidate set. `managed_scope_entry_candidate_invalid`
  and `scope_entry_disposition_invalid` named only the path, so the operator
  read the validator to learn that `candidate_id`, `review_status`, and
  `current_entry_sha256` were required (#46). The refusal now names the
  position and the field (`entries[1]: candidate_id is empty`), the digest
  mismatches say which digest they compare, and the candidate set is
  documented field by field in `docs/managed-scope-and-budget.md`.
- Count a fresh file once. A source created after the last scan has no Entry
  and no Baseline fingerprint, so drift classification files it under both
  Missing and Unbaselined, and Maintain's `authoring_batch` and Guide's batch
  added the lists: two new files promised `total_targets` 4 and `remaining` 2
  with `continuation_required` true while the plan held exactly two
  candidates, and a curation-excluded file was counted although no candidate
  would ever carry it, so remaining never reached zero. Maintain and Guide now
  derive the total from the one authoring-work set Maintain plans from, so the
  batch, the plan, and Guide agree; verify's unresolved-path counts stop
  double-counting the same file. Candidates were never duplicated; only the
  counts were.
- Warn about an E tag that contradicts the file length in Volumes v1. The
  write path read the E-scale thresholds from the Code Volume's own header,
  which in Volumes v1 is one marker line; the dictionary lives in Meta, so no
  threshold was ever found and a four-line file tagged L applied without a
  word. Volumes writes now read the thresholds from Meta's code dictionary
  alone (each Meta section declares its own E Scale line) and answer the
  advisory warning Legacy answers, now localized in both layouts, under
  `audit.warnings`; the S-quota advisory reads the same dictionary. Nothing
  is rejected.
- Name the candidate and field in a batch binding defect. An empty
  `candidate_id` or a malformed `source_sha256` answered a bare bad_args that
  named nothing, and a model that had mistyped one field received the same
  rejection for every resubmission. The rejection now carries a Repair Finding
  with the candidate's position, path, field, and repair action, in the
  vocabulary of the candidate's own domain, with no formal write started.
- Refuse brace alternation in a scope rule. The glob compiler treats `{` as a
  literal, so `assets/*.{png,jpg}` was accepted and matched nothing; adding or
  editing such a rule now fails with the spellings that work. A persisted rule
  is not touched, so no repository stops loading.
- Skip a discovered server whose working directory was deleted. `/proc`
  reports such a directory as `<dir> (deleted)`, and the status page joined
  that text into a root that does not exist.
- Guard the driver audit table in `docs/supply-chain.md` against `go.mod`.
  The pre-tag adversarial review had to move that tag-pinned table's pgx and
  mysql rows by hand after the rc11 driver bumps, because nothing read it. A
  contract test now fails when a listed module's pinned version differs from
  the version `go.mod` requires, and requires the openGauss row to keep
  resolving through the local `replace` to the patched tree under
  `third_party/`. Tests and documentation only; the nine-tool MCP surface and
  every governance identity are unchanged.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc12 is 2026-09-15.

## v0.1.0-rc11

Five more status-panel fixes from the contributor who found the rc10 three,
three dependency updates, and a README that opens with what AOCI-CODE does.

- Recover the raw asset pane after a failed request. A transient `/api/raw`
  error was cached as an empty string, so later unchanged (304) polls never
  fetched it again: the index pane stayed empty and Copy All reported success
  after copying nothing. A failed read is no longer cached, the pane shows the
  disconnected message, Copy All reports failure and leaves the clipboard
  alone, and an unchanged poll retries an uncached asset without holding up
  the next poll. (#41)
- Preserve a replacement registration during `aoci ui --stop`. Stop read the
  registration, probed the old page, and then removed the record
  unconditionally, so a page that registered during the probe kept running
  but could no longer be found by a later `--detach` or `--stop`. Stop now
  removes only the record of the PID it captured, and Register and Unregister
  share a lock under the user cache directory so a replacement cannot land
  between the owner check and the removal. (#42)
- Validate the repository list before the page uses it. A malformed
  `/api/repos` answer replaced the list before any check, the next render
  threw, and startup ended before polling was scheduled. The page now accepts
  only an array whose rows carry a nonempty root, a name, and a nonnegative
  running count, the exact shape the server emits, and otherwise keeps the
  last valid list and selection. (#43)
- Filter the index in one pass. Every matching line walked backward to find
  its section and asset banner, and a standalone Code Volume has no banner, so
  each match scanned to the top: about a second for 16,000 matches. One
  forward pass now remembers the last section and banner; output, matching,
  and counts are unchanged. (#44)
- Resolve a discovered server's relative `--repo` against that server's own
  working directory. On Linux the page resolved it against its own, so
  `aoci --repo project mcp` started elsewhere could show the wrong repository.
  Discovery now reads `/proc/<pid>/cwd` and skips a server whose directory it
  cannot read rather than attach it to a wrong root. (#45)
- Update `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` to 5.11.0, `golang.org/x/sys` to 0.48.0,
  and `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` to 1.10.1 (#38, #39, #40). The release
  module set is the same 22 modules and every license text is byte-identical;
  catalog-only collection was re-verified against PostgreSQL 18 and MySQL 8.4
  with the new drivers.
- Open the README with what AOCI-CODE does and the notes to read before
  starting: the supported system scale, which the index size bounds rather
  than the line count, the time a first index takes, the database index, and
  the read-only, offline, credential-free boundary, all ahead of the one-step
  setup.

Each panel fix carries a regression that fails against the previous page or
registry; the nine-tool MCP surface and every governance identity are
unchanged.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc11 is 2026-09-13.

## v0.1.0-rc10

Three fixes to the status panel, all found by a contributor using it in the
day after rc9 shipped.

- Refresh the page's cached state after an indexed source changes. The cache
  fingerprinted only the formal assets, configuration, Baseline, and
  .git/HEAD, so editing an indexed source moved no watched file and the page
  kept showing the repository aligned while Verify would have called it
  stale. A bounded full recheck now rebuilds the snapshot after two seconds
  or on a manual refresh; an unchanged rebuild keeps its ETag, so 304 still
  works. (#35)
- Recover polling after an invalid state response. An HTTP error with a JSON
  body replaced the last good snapshot, and a body that failed to parse threw
  out of the refresh before the next poll was scheduled, so automatic refresh
  stopped for good with no visible sign. Responses are now checked and parsed
  before being accepted, a failure keeps the last good state, and the poll
  always reschedules. (#36)
- Ignore stale repository and asset responses. Switching repositories or tabs
  while a request was in flight let the late response overwrite the new
  selection, and the raw cache was keyed by asset name alone, so one
  repository's Volume could appear under another's name. State and raw
  responses are now bound to the repository, the request order, and the
  cache generation. (#37)

Each fix carries a regression that fails against the previous page; two of
them execute the embedded page script under node:vm and skip where Node is
absent. The nine-tool MCP surface and every governance identity are
unchanged.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc10 is 2026-09-08.

## v0.1.0-rc9

- Declare a per-tool result-size allowance on `aoci_overview`. A Host that
  persists a large tool result to disk and puts only a preview in the model's
  context turns cognition delivery into a silent failure: the body never
  reaches the model, and no receipt can observe that. The tool now carries a
  static `_meta` declaration raising that threshold for itself alone. Measured
  on Claude Code, the full `24000` chunk_tokens becomes usable and a
  480-object index delivers in three chunks instead of five. It is a
  declaration, not Host capability detection: nothing is probed, and a Host
  that does not recognize the key ignores it, as the MCP specification
  requires. The nine-tool surface, the input schemas, and every governance
  identity are unchanged.
- Add `aoci ui`, a local read-only status page. It shows, for one or more
  repositories at once, the identity, index header, Code and Database Volumes
  with object, line, byte, and token counts against the budget, the exact
  Overview chunk plan at the configured `chunk_tokens`, governance drift and
  Managed Scope counts, host integrations, and the next step the Guide
  recommends — with the prompts a user sends to an agent and the commands that
  clear a block ready to copy. On Linux and WSL it also lists the running
  `aoci mcp` processes of the current user and marks a server whose binary was
  replaced on disk. The page binds loopback addresses only, answers GET and
  HEAD only, takes no lock, appends nothing to the Ledger, and reads the same
  facts Verify, Check, Guide, and Maintain consume through the one Guide
  builder the CLI uses; `aoci mcp` still opens no socket and the nine-tool
  surface is unchanged.
- `aoci ui --detach` starts the panel in the background, detached from the
  shell that asked for it, and prints its link — so an agent can hand a user a
  panel link that still works after the agent's command has returned. A panel
  already running for the repository is reused rather than duplicated;
  `aoci ui --stop` ends it. Registrations live in the user's cache directory,
  never in the repository. The panel also reports how much source the index
  covers (files, lines, tokens) and the compression ratio between source and
  index, shows every Volume verbatim with a copy button, switches language on
  the page, and lets the reader choose the refresh interval.
- Lead the README with the one-step setup. The release-candidate notice moves
  down to the section that obtains the package, and the setup now carries two
  more prompts a user sends verbatim: one that builds the database index once
  the source is declared and its credential variable provisioned, and one that
  re-establishes framework cognition after a context compaction, which is the
  only thing that restores reliability after one.
- Deprecate the Legacy layout. Volumes v1 has been the only layout `aoci init`
  creates since the first candidate, every Legacy-only command is labeled as
  such, and the governed migration exists, so the remaining Legacy code is
  scheduled for removal in v0.2.0. This release only says so; nothing changes
  behavior.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc9 is 2026-09-08.

## v0.1.0-rc8

- Probe the atomic no-replace primitive instead of assuming it. Publishing a
  staged file into a name that must not already exist used `renameat2` with
  `RENAME_NOREPLACE` unconditionally on Linux, but the flag is a filesystem
  capability rather than a kernel one: WSL's DrvFs answers `EINVAL`, so every
  `aoci init` against a path under `/mnt/c` failed with
  `init_volume_create_failed aoci.meta.txt` while the identical repository
  initialized on ext4. A Windows checkout was reachable from WSL for every other
  purpose and not for this one. The flag is now tried first and, where a
  filesystem refuses it outright, the same guarantee is built from `link` plus
  `unlink`: `link` reports `EEXIST` for an occupied name and never replaces it,
  so a refusal still leaves the existing bytes untouched. Being over-broad about
  which errors select the fallback is safe by construction — the fallback
  carries the identical guarantee — while `EEXIST` and the other real answers
  are always propagated. Verified on DrvFs and ext4, and an opt-in test takes a
  directory so a filesystem no CI runner can reach is still checkable.
- Publish a staged file on exFAT under macOS. The Darwin no-replace primitive,
  `renamex_np` with `RENAME_EXCL`, was assumed to answer on every filesystem,
  and a probe run on two macOS runners showed it does not: exFAT returns
  `ENOTSUP`, so `aoci init` could not create a Volume on the one filesystem
  macOS and Windows share on an external drive. It is the shape DrvFs produced
  on Linux, found this time by measuring rather than by a report. The Linux
  repair does not port — its fallback is `link` plus `unlink`, and the
  filesystems that refuse the flag are the msdos family, which has no hard
  links — so Darwin reserves the name with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, which the kernel
  either grants or answers `EEXIST`, and then fills it. Every failure after
  the create removes the target, and both callers verify the published digest
  instead of trusting the write. One trap is recorded in the source: on Darwin
  `ENOTSUP` and `EOPNOTSUPP` are distinct errnos, unlike Linux, and
  classifying only the second would have left the fix inert while looking
  complete. The probe now measures exFAT, FAT32, and HFS+ as separate subtests
  on disk images it creates itself, and a filesystem it cannot measure fails
  instead of passing quietly.
- Prove the upgrade axis. All three black-box suites build every fixture with
  the binary under test, so a persisted preimage that changed *between*
  releases is invisible to them by construction — two such defects reached
  rc6 and rc7 and were caught by hand. `scripts/blackbox/mcp_upgrade.py`
  downloads every release in this changelog, verifies it against its own
  `SHA256SUMS`, builds and authors a repository to `aligned` with it, and then
  requires the binary under test to govern that repository without moving an
  identity, demanding a Scope Change, or rewriting a formal asset: 14 checks
  per released version over two configuration shapes. The second shape is the
  point. Every released `aoci init` writes an explicit `cognition_budget`
  block, so a fixture built only by `init` never resolves the frozen
  `LegacyPolicy` at all, and the suite stayed green against a deliberately
  broken freeze; `nobudget` strips the block before `scan`, reproducing every
  repository created before the block existed, and only that shape turns red.
  The suite runs on the nightly Full Confidence line because it needs Release
  assets, and a download failure fails the run rather than skipping the
  matrix. One exemption is deliberate: the newest changelog section may
  precede its release by the one commit the cut takes, so a 404 for that
  version alone is characterized rather than failed — the gate that must pass
  is the one that creates the release. Any older missing release, any other
  fetch error, and a matrix the exemption would empty still fail.
- Fold current database items out of Maintain transport. Every Database
  Cognition item in the `current` state carried its complete Entry text plus
  evidence and binding hashes while feeding no decision: candidates are built
  from the unbounded facts before the transport projection runs. A repository
  with a 52-table domain that needed nothing paid twenty full Entries per
  Maintain, and one 53 KB response was spilled to disk by its host. The
  summary keeps the count, and `aoci verify --json` and `aoci check --json`
  keep the full enumeration. The suites' host window drops with it from an
  assumed 64 KiB to a measured 48 KiB: bisected on a real host, 49,429-byte
  responses enter the model context and 51,916-byte responses arrive as a
  2 KB preview of a file. The response above had passed the old gate and
  died in production, which is the exact gap between assumption and
  measurement.
- Stop demoting delivered cognition to `invalid` over a pending refresh. The
  read path defaulted `cognition_state` to `invalid` and upgraded it only once
  `refresh_status` settled, so a receipt that had just passed a 10/10
  Attestation read `invalid` the moment the working tree carried in-flight
  edits — inviting a pointless Whole-Index redelivery instead of the Maintain
  cycle the state was pointing at. `invalid` is now reserved for identity
  breaks: no delivery in the session, or a receipt whose repository, service,
  or index no longer matches. A reliable identity-matching receipt under a
  pending refresh reads `uncertain`, which is what the refresh contract says
  drift is.
- Carry runnable `next_commands` on terminal, blocked, and evidence-required
  MCP results. The final Volumes Apply prescribed "Verify, Aggregate Check,
  Guide" in prose — names that exist nowhere on the nine-tool surface — and a
  blocked Maintain carried the bare token
  `explicit_orphan_remove_or_resolve_blocker` while the command that clears
  the block lived only in the CLI Guide; two hosts on two repositories stalled
  on exactly that gap. The command suffixes now live once in the machine
  contract, and the CLI Guide and MCP compose the identical spelling from
  them. The prefix is the running server's own absolute, quoted executable,
  because `aoci` is whatever path the host's MCP configuration names and need
  not be on `PATH`; when it cannot be resolved the field is omitted, since an
  absent advisory beats a wrong command. Placeholders such as `{agent}` are
  the Host's to fill. The field is additive and optional, and the scenario
  suite executes every returned command as returned: Verify, Check, and Guide
  exit 0 after the final Apply, and the acknowledge command clears the block
  it was returned for.
- Say what a raised budget does not buy, and why there is no staleness bypass.
  The scale boundary stated a token ceiling and left the reader to infer that
  raising it removes the limit. It does not: the budget bounds what may be
  written, never what a model can receive, and a Whole-Index is delivered as a
  chunk chain in which every round trip is a place a host compaction can void
  the chain. A repository whose plan estimate runs to several hundred thousand
  tokens has a role problem before it has a budget problem. The same guide now
  records why a content-volatile file whose cognition never changes gets a
  role change or a same-text resubmit rather than a per-file exemption from
  staleness: the source binding is the property the write chain protects.
- Make the release rehearsal run the release's own tooling. `release.yml` had
  moved to newer `checkout`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`,
  `setup-go`, and `goreleaser-action` versions while `ci.yml`,
  `full-confidence.yml`, and `release-rehearsal.yml` stayed on older ones;
  every reference was correctly SHA-pinned with its version comment, so both
  existing contract tests passed and nothing reported the divergence. The
  rehearsal is the one that matters: it was packaging with older tooling than
  the release it rehearsed, so a packaging difference between those versions
  would clear the rehearsal and appear only in the tag-triggered signed run,
  the one that cannot be cheaply retried. All three now match `release.yml`
  exactly, and a new contract test requires an action referenced by more than
  one workflow to be pinned to one SHA, with no exceptions list.
- Run the black-box gate when a black-box suite changes. Full Confidence's
  push filter listed every internal package the suites exercise but not the
  suites themselves, so a fix to `mcp_scenarios.py` for a Windows-only
  attestation failure — section roots are written with forward slashes on
  every platform while the fixture path arrives backslashed — shipped without
  the gate that would prove it. `scripts/blackbox/**` joins the filter, and
  the Windows run it triggered is the proof for the platform that failed.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc8 is 2026-09-03.

## v0.1.0-rc7

- Stop refusing to initialize a repository over files the rules already
  excluded. `aoci init` keyed its initial-scope approval on a counter that
  incremented for every tracked path a built-in rule excluded, so one tracked
  file under `vendor/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `target/` or any other
  built-in generated directory refused initialization outright — and an excluded
  path is never opened, so its presence could not make initialization unsafe.
  Every remediation the refusal offered was wrong for that category: removing
  the files from Git or adding them to `.gitignore` both mean deleting them from
  the repository, `.gitignore` does not untrack an already tracked file, and the
  opt-in it named accepts only `sensitive` paths and reads the configuration
  file that only `init` creates. A repository that vendors its own framework
  source could not be initialized at all. Approval now keys on the counter
  `internal/fs` already maintained for it, which counts only paths whose content
  an explicit opt-in will actually read. Those still require a human, and every
  excluded file keeps its role and stays unread.
- Explain an initialization refusal with the reason that actually stopped it.
  Approval moved to the counter of paths an opt-in will read, but the message
  still branched on the retired one, so a repository blocked because its profile
  assigns no path to the index role was told instead that a tracked file needed
  an explicit decision. Following that advice deleted the file and reached the
  same refusal — the wrong-remediation shape this release exists to remove, left
  one function over.
- Stop letting one approval ratify past a safety boundary. A Managed Scope
  change reports `interaction_required` when a human reviewer may ratify its
  blockers, and the published partition names the blockers that carry no
  reviewer at all, `transport_constraint` among them. The derivation set
  `interaction_required` whenever *any* blocker was ratifiable, and the
  transport-constraint risk is only ever raised inside the coverage-reduction
  branch, which always contributes a ratifiable blocker — so the mixed set was
  the only reachable one, the unratifiable classification could never decide
  anything, and a change the previous release held closed on apply, authorize
  and approve alike could be landed with a single confirmation. The derivation
  now refuses the reviewer route as soon as one blocker is a safety boundary,
  which is what the contract says: the operator resolves the condition instead.
- Deliver the dimension-name diagnostic in the locale it was written for. A
  diagnostic that does not match the active locale is discarded whole and
  replaced by a generic message, and the canonical spelling of every dimension
  is Chinese — so quoting the accepted spellings inside an English refusal made
  the refusal collapse and point the operator at `.aoci/config.json`, which was
  not the problem. The previous release, which offered no hint at all, produced
  a better message on that path. A message now quotes only the spellings its own
  locale can carry, and the test asserts the rendered hint survives the guard
  rather than merely containing the right words.
- Keep the answer `aoci status --deep` gives a repository with no index. The
  Legacy-layout precondition was placed ahead of the absent-index branch and
  shadowed it, replacing "the index does not exist, so --deep cannot run; run
  aoci init first" with a raw filesystem error that also leaked an absolute host
  path into the machine-readable message.
- Hand back a budget remediation that runs. The remediation named `aoci scope
  preview`, and run literally that returns a status document with no preview
  artifact, after which `scope authorize` and `scope apply` both refuse for a
  missing `--preview-file`. `scope preview` emits that artifact only when it is
  given a candidate set, and a configuration-only change still needs one, empty.
  The sequence also has to keep its artifacts out of the worktree: a plan binds
  the repository state, so writing `preview.json` beside the sources changes the
  state the plan was minted against and apply refuses with
  `managed_scope_replay_mismatch` — the first attempt at a runnable remediation
  prescribed the repository root and therefore still did not run. `.aoci` is
  excluded from the Safe Inventory unconditionally, so the finding, the Guide
  instruction in both locales, and `docs/managed-scope-and-budget.md` now put
  every artifact under `.aoci/scope-change/`, and a test pins that the
  prescribed location leaves the plan identity untouched while the worktree
  does not.
- Say in `docs/upgrading.md` that an in-flight Scope Change approval does not
  survive the upgrade. An approval binds the preview envelope digest, and the
  host-independent path change removed two fields from that envelope, so a
  preview and approval minted by v0.1.0-rc5 are refused by v0.1.0-rc6 and the
  reverse is refused too. Nothing is written and no state is damaged, but the
  operator has to finish or discard the pair before replacing the binary. The
  v0.1.0-rc6 note claimed no in-flight approval was stranded; that was true of
  `plan_id` and not of the envelope.
- Ignore the machine-bound backup a host-integration installer writes. The
  installer backs a host config up before rewriting it, and the backup carries a
  timestamp, so it could not be listed as an exact path: the config was ignored
  and its backup, holding the same absolute host paths, was not.
- Fail the Actions version-comment gate when it inspects nothing. Its sibling
  has carried that guard since both were written; this one passed vacuously over
  an empty set, which is the same false green the pair exists to prevent.
- Corrections to the v0.1.0-rc6 notes, which were less accurate than the code.
  `aoci init` installs the Codex compaction prompt and reload hook only when
  both `--agent codex` and `--hooks` are given, not on `init` alone. The bounded
  standard input is two bounds, not one: the hook reads 64 KiB and fails open,
  while `update-entry` reads the Entries request limit and refuses; the command
  is `aoci update-entry`, not `aoci index update-entry`. The unconditional
  `.aoci` and `.git` exclusion lives in `internal/fs/safe_inventory.go`, not in
  `walk.go`.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc7 is 2026-08-31.

## v0.1.0-rc6

- Keep a repository that never chose a cognition budget on the one it has. A
  `config.json` with no `cognition_budget` block resolves the machine default at
  runtime, and that resolved policy's identity is stamped in the Baseline and
  compared on every load — so raising the default would have moved the identity
  of every such repository, flipped budget alignment to false, and demanded a
  human-approved Scope Change the repository did nothing to earn. That
  population is reachable through fully supported commands, because `aoci scope
  rule`, `profile`, and `observe-policy` all write a scope policy and never
  materialize a budget. The legacy policy is now a frozen preimage with its
  identity pinned by a test that says, in the failure message, to revert the
  change rather than update the literal. The new-project default is a separate
  function that may move, and the two must never be collapsed back together.
- Raise the budget a new project starts with to 200000 target / 300000 warning /
  400000 max tokens. Only `aoci init` writes it, and only after proving
  `config.json` did not already exist, so no existing repository is touched:
  every repository created by rc1 through rc5 carries an explicit block and
  keeps it. At this repository's measured density of about 122 tokens per
  object, the previous 240000 covered roughly two thousand objects and the
  warning fired at about fifteen hundred, which put an ordinary large service in
  warning at its first authoring.
- Hand back the remediation a repository over its budget can actually run. The
  refusal reported a bare `cognition_budget_exceeded`, the Guide offered `aoci
  scope status` and an instruction to compress cognition, and `aoci scope budget
  set` — which has existed all along — was named in exactly one line of one
  document. Compression is the wrong answer for an index that grew because the
  repository did, and it was the only answer offered. The finding now carries
  the numbers that produced it and both levers, the blocked Guide carries Stop
  facts and the command that raises the budget, and the instructions state that
  a raise is a governed change requiring `aoci scope preview`, human approval,
  and `aoci scope apply`. `docs/managed-scope-and-budget.md` states that the
  published numbers are the new-project default rather than a system limit, and
  a test holds those numbers to the code that produces them.
- Report the Whole-Index that `aoci scope status` is actually governing. Under
  Volumes v1 it measured `aoci.txt` alone — the Root pointer, a few hundred
  bytes naming the other assets — and announced 101 tokens and zero Entries for
  a repository whose index is 58166 tokens over 476 objects. That is the command
  every blocked budget path hands the operator, so it told them their index was
  empty at the moment they were being refused for its size. Per-field costs and
  per-Entry violations now come from the object Volume, and the Whole-Index
  total is rebound to the complete declared asset set. Legacy repositories keep
  the single-asset measurement unchanged.
- Let a repository's own S quota declaration govern the gate that refuses its
  Entries. `internal/cognition` held a fourth, private copy of the quota rule
  that read the machine default directly and never looked at the Meta
  declaration, while the authoring contract handed to the model is built from
  that declaration: a repository declaring a wider band was told the wider
  number, authored to it, and was refused at the machine default by a message
  naming a limit the operator had already changed. No edit to the declaration
  could clear it. Resolution now runs through one place, and that place only
  ever loosens — a declaration wider than the machine default governs, a
  narrower one does not tighten. The asymmetry is deliberate: an error-level
  gate that honoured a tightening would make an already-persisted Volume
  unloadable the moment an operator narrowed their own Header, taking Verify,
  Check, Guide, Maintain and Overview down together. With the floor, nothing
  that loads today can fail after this upgrade, and a repository that could not
  load its own authored Entries now can. The declaration is read before any
  object Volume is judged rather than only for Volumes the Root happens to
  declare after it, on both the load path and the volume-commit path.
- Correct the published claim about that gate. `spec/public/s-field-discipline`
  stated that an over-quota S "emits warning-level violations that pass through
  without blocking persistence", which is what the curation check does and the
  opposite of what the Volumes v1 object gate does. The two gates, their
  different levels, and the reason they resolve a declaration differently are
  now stated. This repository already enforces that published numbers match the
  code; the divergence survived because a published behavioural claim had no
  such gate, so one was added.
- Name a dimension the header declared in a spelling the parser does not accept.
  Writing `#S-quota` where `#S quota` is expected was indistinguishable from
  declaring nothing: the operator's numbers silently became the machine
  defaults. For the E scale dimension it was worse — the declaration was
  discarded, the fallback dictionary substituted, and the operator's own
  declared symbol then reported as illegal against "the E scale line in the
  header", the line that had just been thrown away, which `aoci_update_entry`
  treats as a hard refusal. The accepted spellings did not change, because
  accepting more of them would turn a currently dark gate on for repositories
  whose header uses hyphens and break writes that succeed today. A rejected
  spelling is now reported as a declaration that is present and unreadable,
  quoted as written and alongside the accepted forms. It is reported only for a
  dimension that received no acceptable line, so a stray line beside a correct
  declaration stays silent.
- Stop paying for a formatter on every file on every call. `managedscope`
  recompiled a glob pattern for each rule and path pair — 171745 compilations
  over 48 distinct patterns for one `aoci check` — and `baseline.HashFile` ran
  `go/format.Source` over every Go file, which profiled at 94.7% of that
  function against 1.5% for the SHA-256 it supplements. A formatted digest is
  only ever consulted when the raw digest changed, so computing it for a file
  whose bytes are unchanged is work no judgement can use. Patterns are memoized
  on their exact bytes, and a caller holding the Baseline may supply it so an
  unchanged file skips the reparse. Every digest is byte-identical to a cold
  hash: reuse requires the raw digest, the size, and the normalized digest to
  agree before any stored value is carried over. `aoci check` on this repository
  went from 2.52s to 0.78s with `check --json` output unchanged byte for byte.
- Stop deciding Managed Scope path matching by asking the host filesystem.
  `filesystemCaseSensitive` probed the running machine and folded the answer
  into the applied scope identity, so one repository carried two different
  governance identities depending on whether it was checked out on Linux or on
  Windows. The equivalence bridge built over that re-evaluated every path under
  the opposite semantics and published an alternate identity when the roles
  provably coincided, which hid the difference without removing it: where a rule
  and a path genuinely differ in case, two platforms could not both be aligned,
  and one of them received a `scope_change_required` with no real cause.
  Matching now uses Git semantics — exact and case-sensitive — on every host,
  and the probe and the bridge are gone. The identity preimage deliberately
  keeps its case-sensitive form, so every receipt established on a
  case-sensitive filesystem stays valid unchanged. Only a receipt recorded under
  the historical case-insensitive semantics migrates, and where both semantics
  assigned the same roles its plan is identity-only — no role change, no Entry
  change, `aoci.txt` byte-identical — and policy-bound auto authorizes it
  without a human. Where they genuinely diverge it is a real role change and is
  authorized as one. `docs/upgrading.md` states the boundary and the command.

- Show a vanished Observe file in the plan the operator has to acknowledge.
  `scope status` keys an Observe removal on the source snapshot while the plan
  keyed it on the role map, and a file deleted from the worktree but still
  tracked by Git is evaluated as an unsafe filesystem object, so it stayed in
  the role map and read as reclassified by policy rather than gone. `status`
  listed it, the plan did not, and the review set `aoci scope acknowledge`
  submits could never match — the refusal named neither the extra path nor the
  missing one. The role map remains the key, because it is what separates a
  deliberate Observe-to-Exclude transition from a path that simply vanished;
  only the vanished set is added to what the plan reports.

- Close a staged host-agent Entries run that a later transaction has already
  superseded. Such a run could stay pending forever once a legitimate governance
  transaction had advanced the formal Index from the same preimage: the recovery
  path read every changed Index as unknown drift, even when a complete
  content-addressed receipt chain proved the staged run itself had written
  nothing, and nothing the operator did cleared the pending state. Closing one
  now requires a pristine stage-only run, no apply Ledger evidence, locked and
  stable Index, Baseline, and repository state, no pending transaction or CAS
  asset, and a unique gap-free, fork-free, time-ordered chain whose first
  receipt belongs to a transaction other than the staged batch. A stored closure
  is revalidated on every later pending check, so a deleted or tampered receipt
  reopens the run rather than leaving a Manifest flag to be trusted.

- Reload the cognition contract after a Codex compaction, and state why a probe
  cannot survive one. `aoci init` installs a compaction prompt and a reload
  hook, and the hidden `aoci hook codex-compact` emits developer context
  carrying a fresh refresh event id. The runtime contract and the public refresh
  spec now state the rule the hook serves: a compacted handoff carries no
  Whole-Index, Overview, Challenge, or Attestation body; an index receipt copied
  into a handoff cannot prove the resumed model's cognition; and a cognition
  probe is valid only when no compaction is known. A probe answered after a
  known compaction passes while proving nothing.

- Pin every GitHub Actions reference to a commit SHA, and stop letting an
  absent gate script report success. `release.yml` has been pinned from the
  start because it signs, attests, and publishes artifacts, but `ci.yml`,
  `full-confidence.yml`, and `release-rehearsal.yml` kept movable tags — and
  those three check out the source, run the gates, and decide whether the
  repository is green, so an upstream retag could change this repository's
  verdict with nothing visible in its own history. All 35 references in those
  three workflows now carry a 40-hex commit SHA and a comment naming the version
  it stands for, because a bare SHA can be diffed but not reviewed;
  `internal/safety` enforces both properties and fails if it inspects nothing,
  so it cannot pass while covering an empty set. The pins are the versions
  already in use resolved to their current commits, since pinning and upgrading
  are separate decisions. The `safety` and `check-deps` Makefile gates each ran
  their script only when the file existed and otherwise printed a skip notice
  and succeeded; a missing gate script is now a failure, because a broken gate
  that reports success is the same false green one layer down.

- Bound the standard input the CLI will read. The pretool hook runtime and
  `aoci index update-entry` both read stdin through an unbounded `io.ReadAll`,
  while the same repository already read `LimitReader(max+1)` on the Agent stage
  and curation protocols — the discipline existed and two entry points missed
  it. Both now read through one bound, and the two callers answer an oversize
  payload differently on purpose. Hook infrastructure must never block a
  workflow, and its input carries only a tool name and a path, so the hook fails
  open on either an oversize input or a read error and discards the payload
  rather than buffering it. `update-entry` refuses as a configuration error
  before any formal write, and also refuses `--entry` together with `--stdin`,
  because silently preferring one would write content the operator did not
  intend. A refused oversize input leaves the Index untouched.

- Make `aoci status --deep` behave the way it is documented. It is a
  Legacy-only command, but it ran against a Volumes repository and reported a
  drift set the Volumes governance path owns, so the public documents and the
  binary disagreed about one command. The existing write-path precondition is
  now reachable under a neutral name and answers both callers, because a second
  copy of a guard is how it silently stops covering one of them. The public CLI
  runtime contract states both this routing and the standard-input bound.

- Give every refused Managed Scope change a reviewer, or a stated reason there
  is none. A cognition coverage reduction planned under `inherit` with effective
  `auto` reported `interaction_required=false`, so `scope approve` answered
  `managed_scope_approval_not_required` while `scope apply` and `scope
  authorize` stayed blocked by `managed_scope_auto_authorization_blocked`: the
  change had no approver at all and the repository was stuck. The auto branch
  derived its answer from a single risk field, so exactly one of the twelve
  reasons `autoAuthorizationBlockers` can refuse was ever routed to a person.
  The answer is now derived from that same blocker set rather than a second
  hand-kept copy of it, and the reasons are partitioned once. Ratifiable, and
  therefore routed to independent review: posture and budget relaxations,
  high-risk content, P0 and P1 findings, cognition coverage reductions, and an
  already-decided explicit drop. Safety boundaries, which carry no reviewer
  because the operator must resolve the condition instead of approving past it:
  a transport-constraint basis, an incomplete retention review, an exceeded
  enforce-mode budget, an absent recovery direction, and any business-source
  write or postimage. An unclassified reason fails the build instead of
  defaulting, because both defaults are wrong — one recreates the dead end and
  the other would let an approval wave a safety boundary through. The public
  Managed Scope contract states the partition and the rule that both sets come
  from one enumeration.

- Stop refusing a Scope Change over a line ending. `internal/scopechange`
  compared sources by raw SHA-256 and so became the last consumer bypassing
  `baseline.EquivalentFingerprints` — the function whose own contract calls
  itself the single entry point for that judgement. An earlier release closed
  the same class in `internal/volumegovernance` and declared that package the
  only bypasser; nothing enforced the claim. `core.autocrlf` is the Git for
  Windows default, so one ordinary checkout left Verify, Check, and Guide
  calling a file aligned with no work to do while every Scope Change hard-failed
  on it with `managed_scope_index_source_stale`. Neither side offered a move
  that cleared the block, the operator concluded their Entries were unreadable,
  and upgrading could not help because the earlier fix never reached this
  package. No Entry was ever lost: the blocker fires only when the file is
  already an index-role object in the Baseline. Every comparison in the package
  is now classified rather than swept. Source equivalence runs through
  `EquivalentFingerprints` — the stale blocker, the coverage-reduction grading,
  the formal Volume and Root Baseline guards, and observed evidence drift —
  while identity bindings stay raw, because candidate source digests, Entry
  preimages, and the historical Root reconstruction must recover the stored SHA
  exactly. Tolerance is not silence: the Plan carries `source_line_ending_only`
  so the operator sees which sources were accepted as equivalent before the
  postimage Baseline records their new bytes. That field is omitted when empty,
  so a plan without such drift serializes exactly as before, its `plan_id` is
  unchanged, and no in-flight approval is stranded.

- Say in `docs/troubleshooting.md` that a committed tree-wide digest must
  exclude `.aoci`. A release process that hashes the whole tree and commits the
  result back covers `.aoci/baseline.json`, which is tracked by design, and the
  two form a fixed point: the digest depends on the Baseline, and the Baseline
  records the fingerprint of the file holding the digest. No pair of contents
  satisfies both, so the repository keeps one permanently stale Entry. This is a
  foreseeable interaction rather than a defect, and AOCI already makes the same
  decision internally — `internal/fs/walk.go` excludes `.aoci` and `.git`
  unconditionally to prevent self-swallowing, so the Business Source manifest
  never contains a governance asset. Nothing under `.aoci` participates in a
  build or in the source a review covers, so the exclusion makes such a digest
  answer its intended question rather than weakening it.
- Report one blocker per root cause. A Managed Scope policy that no longer
  matches its receipt already reports `scope_change_required`, but the business
  source manifest refuses to build in that state, and every manifest failure
  collapsed into one generic `business_source_manifest_invalid` whichever cause
  produced it. A reported project received both codes, and the second one named
  a subsystem that was working — so the operator investigated it and found
  nothing, because there was nothing to find. The derived report is dropped, and
  every other cause now carries its exact machine token instead of being erased.
  The cause is recognised through a sentinel rather than message text, so the
  rule survives a wording change.
- Hand back a remediation the repository can actually run. The Volumes Guide
  reaches its scope-change instruction only after the baseline-missing branch has
  returned, so a Baseline always exists there and `scan` always refuses — yet the
  instruction ended by offering `scan` anyway. It now states that a Baseline is
  present and names the governed Scope Change as the path.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc6 is 2026-08-30.

## v0.1.0-rc5

- Stop treating a line-ending rewrite as a reason to stop governing a
  repository. `internal/volumegovernance` compared formal Volumes by raw
  SHA-256, making it the one consumer in the repository that bypassed
  `baseline.EquivalentFingerprints` — the function whose own contract declares
  it the single entry point for that judgement — and therefore the one place
  that ignored `line_ending_tolerance`, which defaults to true. `core.autocrlf`
  is the Git for Windows default, so an ordinary Windows checkout rewrote every
  Volume and hard-blocked the Guide over a difference the team policy already
  calls equivalent, while identical rewrites of business sources stayed
  authorable. Such a difference is now reported as
  `code_volume_line_ending_only` (with `root_`, `meta_`, and `database_`
  siblings) carrying the repair, and does not block.
- Refuse a `scan` that would publish a Baseline without the Volumes it governs.
  Scan takes its inventory from Git, so a formal cognition asset covered by
  `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, or `core.excludesFile` was silently absent
  from the Baseline; the repository then failed far away on a blocked Guide that
  named neither the rule nor the file. The refusal names both, and `--dry-run`
  reports it rather than promising a scan that would fail.
- Report Root and Meta drift. Nothing checked them, so a repository was aligned
  according to Verify and Guide while every Scope Change refused over the same
  bytes, and only one of those authorities named a file. Both now use the
  vocabulary the Code and Database Volumes already use, under the same condition
  a Scope Change refuses on.
- Give new repositories the line-ending protection AOCI applies to itself.
  `init` writes a `.gitattributes` normalizing text to LF, and never rewrites an
  existing one.
- Say when the base Go toolchain is older than `go.mod` requires, instead of
  reporting it as a supply-chain fault. The `licenses` and
  `opengauss-connector` gates pin `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` so the audit reports one
  Go identity, and under that pin an older base install stops them — but
  `check-opengauss-connector.sh` wraps every `go mod download` failure into
  "could not download the pinned upstream module", so a base install one patch
  behind read as a compromised or unreachable upstream. `make full` now
  compares the base toolchain against the `go` directive first and, when it is
  older, names both versions, explains why a plain `go version` can disagree,
  and offers either installing the newer Go or pointing `GO_BIN` at one already
  on the machine. The comparison is `>=`, so a newer base install is never
  blocked.
- Show the confirmation prompt before the phrase is read, not after the command
  has exited. The library entry point buffers both writers into memory and
  flushes them once Execute returns, so every TTY digest confirmation wrote its
  prompt into a buffer and then blocked on stdin with nothing on screen. The
  prompt carries the exact phrase the operator has to type, so the one thing
  they needed was the one thing they could not see: they typed blind or gave up,
  and the phrase appeared only alongside the failure. The prompt now goes
  straight to the process stderr the confirmed branch has already proven is a
  terminal. Every `scope approve`, `scope safety approve`, `baseline scope
  approve`, `cognition bootstrap`, and `cognition migration` confirmation is
  affected.
- Let an approval land in a file instead of being carried by hand. `scope
  approve`, `scope safety approve`, and `baseline scope approve` take
  `--out-file`, so the artifact `scope apply --approval-file` needs is written
  where it is wanted rather than printed to stdout for the operator to
  redirect. Forgetting that redirect silently discarded a confirmation that
  cannot be reused. The path is checked before the human is asked, so a bad
  path never costs a confirmation; the file is created only when nothing is
  already there, and is readable by its owner alone, because until the change is
  applied anything that can read it can stand in for the human who typed the
  phrase.
- Give a Managed Scope posture relaxation the reviewer it always needed. Auto
  authorization correctly refuses to let a posture ratify its own weakening, but
  refusing was only half the contract: `interaction_required` was derived from
  the weaker desired mode, so desiring `auto` also decided that no reviewer was
  needed and the blocked change had no approver at all. Once left, `auto` could
  not be re-entered by any governed path. A relaxation now reports
  `interaction_required` and is authorized under the posture the current
  Baseline receipt proves, so exactly one `scope approve` ratifies it while
  `policy_bound_auto` still refuses it and ordinary auto plans stay fully
  automatic.
- Stop counting a deleted file's stale Baseline record as a cognition coverage
  reduction. A path the current Safe Inventory no longer sees has neither an
  Entry nor source bytes left to lose, so retiring its record is bookkeeping;
  excluded paths remain in the evaluation, so an existing source that still owes
  an Entry is unaffected and keeps raising P1. Previously one such record — a
  file deleted three weeks earlier — forced a pure policy change to high risk and
  demanded a human approval that protected nothing.
- Say what a Managed Scope confirmation actually approves. The prompt now leads
  with the effects that matter — cognition Entries removed, files losing Index
  coverage, a weakened posture, a relaxed budget, high-risk content admitted —
  and states plainly when a change carries none of them. A confirmation phrase
  binds the approval to one exact plan; it was never meant to be the only thing
  the approver could read.
- Index the three MCP black-box harnesses. They are executable contracts run by
  name with their own preconditions, which is exactly what the admission rule
  admits, and each Entry now carries the precondition a reader needs: conformance
  expects an established repository and zero formal writes, scenarios writes only
  disposable fixtures, and lifecycle needs Docker for the database suite while
  `repo-c` reaches aligned without drift. The earlier exclusion rested on a wrong
  cost model — an Entry is about 110 tokens of FRAS, never the Python body — so
  its recorded reason is corrected rather than deleted. Three Entries cost about
  700 tokens against a 120k target.
- Managed Scope approval mode is now `review`: applying the harness change
  required independent human review, because any Scope Change re-evaluates every
  role and a Baseline record for a file deleted in `82120db` therefore appears as
  a coverage reduction. Policy-bound auto authorization correctly refused it.
- State the repository's verification obligations and its Whole-Index admission
  rule in `AGENTS.md`, where every Agent session reads them. The gate table maps
  a kind of change to the gate that actually covers it, and it records the fact
  no gate output carries: `clean-room-smoke`, `licenses`, `race`, `vuln`, and
  `database-integration` run only under `make full`, so a green `make fast`
  proves nothing about them. The admission rule states that a test earns an
  Entry only when it is an executable contract run by name with its own
  preconditions; ordinary package tests stay `observe`, and a test that locks a
  fact is recorded in the locked object's `S`. A cross-layer test now fails when
  any `*_test.go` acquires an Entry and when either rule is dropped from
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Have `aoci init` add the agent host configuration it just wrote to the
  repository's `.gitignore`. Those files carry machine-bound absolute paths, and
  a committed copy silently no-ops another machine's `init` because every
  installer detects an existing entry by key presence. The timing is what made
  this worth fixing in `init` rather than in prose: Managed Scope roles are fixed
  by the first `scan`, `scan --force` cannot advance them, and removing a path
  afterwards is a coverage reduction that needs an approved Scope Change — so a
  default `init` then `scan` used to leave a machine-bound file as a permanent
  authoring target. `init` appends under its own marked block, never rewrites
  maintainer content, skips any path Git already tracks, and does nothing when no
  host configuration was written.
- Split the one-step setup instruction in both public READMEs into the two turns
  it always was. The index is authored through AOCI's MCP tools, and the server
  `init` writes is not loaded in the session that wrote it, so the old single
  prompt asked the Agent to finish work it could not reach. The first
  instruction now runs `init` and `scan`, asks for any configuration a host does
  not write itself, and stops with an explicit restart hand-off; the second
  confirms the MCP server and builds the index. `scan`, which establishes the
  Baseline every later step needs, was missing from the one-step path entirely.
- Say in both READMEs how to tell which AOCI a host is actually connected to:
  `cognition_receipt.mcp_service_version` and `runtime_repository_root` from any
  Overview `check_only` response or any Maintain response, and the `command` in
  the project's `.mcp.json` or the equivalent host configuration for the binary
  path. Replacing bytes on disk does not change a running MCP process.
- Carry the `aoci scope acknowledge` remediation in a blocked Volumes Guide whose
  Observe evidence is pending review. `observe_change_policy` defaults to
  `review_required`, so an ordinary edit to any Observe-role file blocks
  authoring; the Legacy Plan already routed that state to acknowledgement, while
  the Volumes Guide reported a bare `observed_pending` finding with no command.
  The response now adds the scope status and acknowledge commands, an
  `observed_pending` stop with cause and safe next action, and the instruction to
  review the reported evidence before acknowledging.
- Show the index header both public READMEs previously only described: the Root
  manifest that declares each participating Volume with its kind, path, format,
  dependency, and activation state, and the Meta header that carries the object
  protocol, the FRAS discipline, the machine limits authority, S admission, and
  the S quota. Each locale quotes what its own `aoci init` writes, and a
  cross-layer test binds every quoted line to the rendered template and the
  machine S quota, so a template or limits change cannot leave the published
  example describing a header the binary no longer produces.
- Correct published facts in the release-facing READMEs: the status badge named
  the superseded `v0.1.0-rc3`, the black-box suites were advertised as 44
  conformance checks, 22 fault-injection scenarios, and two lifecycle fixtures
  when they are 46, 30, and three, the English documentation map linked the
  Chinese Windows host-agent original instead of its English rendering, and the
  one worked FRAS example separated `A` items with semicolons where the public
  contract and every shipped Entry use commas.
- Make the conformance check count a property of the suite rather than of the
  repository it is pointed at. The Overview chain is tallied as two aggregate
  checks instead of two per chunk, and the probe pair is graded unconditionally,
  so the published number no longer moves when an index crosses a chunk boundary
  or a probe is not issued, and `AOCI_REPO` runs against a foreign target no
  longer look for this repository's documents.
- Carry the issue #8 `aoci cognition bootstrap` correction into the Chinese
  README, which had kept the pre-fix wording: bootstrap never targets an
  initialized Volumes v1 repository, and a Volumes skeleton with zero Entries is
  established through `aoci scan`, then Guide and no-argument `aoci_maintain`.
- Make the black-box suites enforce their own published numbers. Conformance and
  scenarios now fail when the count printed by the run disagrees with any
  document that advertises it, and the lifecycle suite fails when a committed
  fixture is not named where the suites are advertised, so these counts cannot
  drift silently again.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc5 is 2026-08-17.

## v0.1.0-rc4

- Add a narrow openGauss 6.0.5 LTS A/PG Schema Evidence collector, backed by a
  reproducibly patched official Connector v1.0.8, strict remote `verify-full`
  TLS, fail-closed unsupported catalog handling, and disposable real-engine
  acceptance without changing Evidence v1 or the nine-tool MCP surface.
- Expand the fixed general-purpose Code and Database starter A/B dictionaries,
  make all C importance digits from 1 through 9 available, retain optional D
  grammar and the existing E scale, and use `EG7T` as the starter Code example.
- Reserve starter `G` for genuinely cross-domain objects and `Z` for understood
  objects that fit no named category; evidence gaps do not become `Z` or S
  constraints. The new defaults affect only fresh initialization and do not
  migrate or retag repositories with an existing formal Meta.
- Report exact Code candidate binding mismatches and distinguish
  `code_plan.batch_id` from the cross-domain `authoring_batch.batch_identity`
  without changing the nine-tool MCP surface or request Schema; actual source
  drift remains a stopped replan condition instead of a copied-field repair.
- Expose the aggregate Check command in an authoring-required Volumes Guide and
  close the final successful batch through Verify, Aggregate Check, and Guide
  while preserving intermediate-batch and Legacy Entries Stage behavior.
- Return the same Verify, Aggregate Check, and Guide closure directly from a
  successful final Volumes Apply, while leaving paged, Legacy, and Cognition
  Optimization actions unchanged.
- Advance an already-managed Root fingerprint in the same Database Cognition
  Bootstrap Baseline postimage as the Root descriptor update, and narrowly
  reconcile the canonical historical state left by earlier Bootstrap versions.
- Add a session cognition line to `aoci_search`, `aoci_get_entries`, and
  `aoci_header`, and an optional two-question cognition probe on a
  `check_only` Overview, so a Host can tell whether it still holds the
  delivered Whole-Index instead of re-requesting it. The line is computed from
  session facts with no repository scan, receipt identity drift never raises
  it, and the probe measures recall without advancing the refresh generation.
- Grade the Whole-Index Attestation as assimilation rather than verbatim
  recall: the Challenge passes at 80 percent or better with at most one object
  identity miss, core F is judged by normalized token similarity that splits
  Han, Kana, and Hangul into character bigrams so every Locale meets the same
  floor, and object identity and Tag stay exact. `fail` is reserved for a
  foreign envelope or no correct ordinal; every other shortfall records
  `partial`, so an honest complete-coverage claim can no longer grade below
  the same answers submitted with a hedged one.
- Accept `host_delivery_confirmation` and `model_cognition_attestation` in one
  call or in separate calls in either order. Both halves bind the same
  delivered body, so the session remembers each half per body and grades the
  merged evidence; an explicitly carried half supersedes the remembered one,
  and a fresh complete delivery resets that memory.
- Size one authoring batch for the Host tool-result window. The team key
  `code_cognition_batch_entries` (machine default 20, wire ceiling 200) sets
  how many candidates one Maintain asks the model to author inline, and
  Maintain keeps per-item governance enumerations to a leading sample with
  complete counts under `governance.list_truncation` and `sets.review_total`.
  Candidates, plans, and receipts stay complete, `aoci verify` and `aoci check`
  still list every item, and the Database Evidence byte gate defaults to
  64 KiB.
- Return structured repair findings instead of an internal error when an
  enforce-mode cognition budget rejects an Entry: every violated field carries
  `candidate_index`, `field`, `actual_tokens`, and `max_tokens`, whole-index
  excess and violations outside the batch stay a batch-level stop, and a CJK
  `S` field that crosses its token band is now a locatable repair.
- Accept model-authored `R` exactly as written: AOCI never checks one Entry's
  relations against another Entry, so a relation whose target is missing,
  unmanaged, scheduled for a later batch, or ambiguous by bare name is
  persisted unchanged and produces no Finding. `aoci_update_entry` no longer
  returns `impact_relation_unresolved`, `impact_relation_ambiguous`, or
  `impact_relation_invalid`; per-Entry FRAS structure, the tag dictionary, the
  C-driven S quota, source binding, and the projected budget stay enforced,
  and a newly authored or changed relation must still use a canonical `code:`
  or `database://` identity.
- Stop letting `R` reschedule a Code authoring batch: a submitted batch is no
  longer answered with a zero-write `code_candidate_relation_replan_required`
  replacement plan, so a repository whose Entries reference each other across
  batches, including a mutually-referencing cluster larger than the machine
  Code batch size, now reaches `aligned` in the ordinary rolling batches
  instead of replanning. Receipts issued before this change still load, so a
  plan already in flight survives the upgrade.
- Keep `R` references from other Entries from blocking ordinary
  `aoci_remove_entry` orphan removal, which no longer fails with
  `remove_orphan_relation_still_valid`, and from making a legacy `aoci.txt`
  Index `ineligible` in `aoci cognition migration snapshot` when one relation
  names a path that is gone. Any dangling annotation left behind stays
  model-owned until the model's next Whole-Index read; orphan proof, Guard,
  exact preimages, and the existing Entries recovery path are unchanged.
- Report `R` problems only from the Entry line itself: `aoci index entries
  check` still warns about that line's own form, such as an empty item, a
  placeholder mixed with real targets, or a full-width comma, and those
  warnings still never reject an Entry; it no longer resolves targets on disk
  to warn that one is missing, duplicated, self-referencing, or not a regular
  file, and `aoci cognition system relations` reports no relation `findings`.
  The hard safety gate on the actual write `path` is unchanged.
- Carry the `aoci scan` remediation in a blocked Volumes Guide that has no
  Baseline: the response adds the `scan` command, a `baseline_missing` stop
  with cause and safe next action, and the instruction to author nothing
  before a Baseline exists. An initialized Volumes repository with zero
  Entries is completed through scan, Guide, and no-argument Maintain;
  `aoci cognition bootstrap` governs only an uninitialized repository or the
  exact zero-Entry Legacy minimal skeleton.
- Roll a partially written `[code,database]` receipt batch forward when the
  identical evidence-bound candidates are resubmitted, so an interruption
  between the Code and Database writes finishes the remaining Volume instead
  of stopping at `code_candidate_plan_stale` behind a pending
  `.aoci/transactions` receipt; the roll-forward still requires a version-4
  recovery receipt proving that Volume's own postimage, and the fixed
  Code-then-Database order, `[code]`, and `[database]` batches are unchanged.
- Carry the plan-time Curation exclusions in the managed-scope-change envelope
  as `curation_exclusions` and replay them when verifying after publication,
  so a reviewed `curation.json` exclude decision for an already baselined path
  applies and archives as one transaction instead of leaving a complete
  transaction that can never be archived; envelopes without the field keep
  recomputing exclusions from the current Baseline, and `envelope_version` is
  unchanged.
- Keep the partition facts of mid-level tables when linking multi-level
  PostgreSQL partitioning: a table that is both a partition and a partition
  parent now records `parent_object` and `bound` while retaining
  `partitioned`, `method`, `expression`, and any `child_objects` already
  linked to it, instead of being rewritten as a non-partitioned leaf; the
  narrow non-partitioned openGauss profile and Evidence v1 are unchanged.
- Name the cause when `aoci init` stops with
  `managed_scope_auto_authorization_blocked`: the bilingual message now
  separates tracked paths excluded by a built-in safety rule (up to five
  named, the rest as a +N remainder) from a profile that assigns no path to
  the index role and from configured exact high-risk opt-ins, pointing the
  first two at `aoci scope safety` and `--scope-profile production`; `--json`
  reports `error_code` as that machine code instead of the generic `config`,
  and the exit code is unchanged.
- Record the effective apply authorization mode in the Managed Scope Baseline
  receipt as `apply_authorization_mode`, and raise
  `approval_policy_relaxation` when a Scope Change runs under a mode weaker
  than the one that receipt records; that risk is `high`, blocks
  `policy_bound_auto`, and forces interaction under `legacy`, so a team's
  review posture can no longer be lowered and self-ratified inside the same
  transaction. A receipt written before this field is not retroactively
  blocked, so the guarantee starts at the first receipt that records a mode;
  an unrecognized recorded mode fails closed.
- Accept a Managed Scope Baseline receipt recorded under the opposite
  filesystem case semantics when every managed path provably takes the same
  role and the same fingerprint participation under both, so a Baseline
  established on a case-sensitive checkout no longer stops a case-insensitive
  one with `scope_change_required`. The receipted value becomes the reported
  `desired_policy_identity`; any real case divergence leaves
  `alternate_policy_identity` empty and keeps the stop.
- Route every read-only Git query against a scanned repository through one
  hardened invocation that disables `core.fsmonitor`, `core.hooksPath`, and
  `core.pager` on the command line, so a target repository's own `.git/config`
  can no longer point those reads at a program for Git to run while it walks
  the working tree. Safe Inventory collection and business-source manifest
  building both use it; file listing still passes `core.quotepath=false`,
  every call still sets `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, and the reported tracked,
  untracked, and ignored facts are unchanged.
- Stop the Windows-only non-atomic overwrite fallback of `AtomicWrite` from
  destroying the previous content by renaming the target to a same-directory
  backup before the retry, restoring that backup when the retry fails, and
  keeping both copies with both paths named in the error only when even the
  restore fails; the fallback still runs only after a normal atomic rename
  has failed and never on other platforms.
- Pin `* text=auto eol=lf` in `.gitattributes` so a source checkout is
  byte-identical on every platform: the Windows default `core.autocrlf=true`
  can no longer rewrite tracked text to CRLF, so a Windows checkout still
  matches the raw-byte Baseline instead of leaving `aoci_maintain` blocked on
  the whole tree. Every tracked text file is already LF, so the
  repository-wide renormalization changes no committed bytes.
- Report `service_binary_replaced_on_disk: true` in the Volumes
  `aoci_maintain` result, `aoci_rules`, and the final Overview metadata when
  the service binary's on-disk size or mtime no longer matches what the
  running process started from, so restarting the host MCP integration
  becomes a machine fact instead of manual diagnosis. The fact is advisory:
  it blocks nothing, is absent when there is no drift, counts a vanished
  binary as replaced, stays off when the startup probe records no identity,
  and does not change the nine-tool MCP surface.
- State where the running version and binary path come from in the Runtime
  Rules and the AGENTS integration block: the service version is
  `cognition_receipt.mcp_service_version` in any `check_only` Overview or
  Maintain response, the binary path is the `command` in the project's
  `.mcp.json`, and the CLI need not be on `PATH`, so a missing shell command
  never means AOCI is absent.
- Add three standalone black-box suites under `scripts/blackbox/` that drive a
  built `aoci` binary as a real stdio MCP client and never import internal
  packages: `mcp_conformance.py` makes 58 read-only checks of the handshake,
  the nine-tool registry, input Schemas, response shapes, and malformed input;
  `mcp_scenarios.py` runs 30 fault-injection scenarios for cursor replay and
  tampering, write-lifecycle rejection, crash injection, and racing writers
  over disposable fixtures; and `mcp_lifecycle.py` takes three frozen fixture
  projects, including a 453-object one, from `init` through incremental
  maintenance, Database Evidence acceptance, schema drift, multi-batch
  authoring, and re-alignment, with an optional real-agent model track. Every
  suite now also asserts that no non-Overview tool response exceeds 64 KB
  under default configuration, so a response can never grow past what an
  ordinary Host displays inline. All three need only Python 3, git, and a
  binary, honor `AOCI_BIN`, and ship with a repository clone rather than with
  Release archives.
- Correct the public delivery contract in
  `spec/public/aoci-overview-delivery-v1.txt` and `docs/overview-delivery.md`:
  an exact replay of a genuine cursor idempotently re-serves the identical
  Chunk bytes, and because a cursor is re-derivable from its bound facts
  alone, an unchanged Index and `chunk_tokens` accept the same cursor across
  MCP process restarts. Invalid, missing, reordered, and cross-chain use
  still fails closed, `overview_snapshot_changed` and
  `overview_chunk_tokens_changed` still require a restart at Chunk 1, no
  delivery Session or transaction is persisted, and the Volumes governance
  binding remains in-memory session state that does not carry across
  processes.
- Correct the `aoci_remove_entry` description and the Volumes and system
  cognition Specs to state the behavior the machine actually has: an R
  reference from another Entry never blocks orphan removal, a dangling
  annotation left behind is model-owned semantics handled on the next
  Whole-Index read, and relation content produces no Finding, so `findings`
  stays in the public shape and stays empty. Removal and projection behavior
  is unchanged.
- Document the shipped `meta` scope of `aoci_overview` and the additive
  `aoci_maintain` input `intent=cognition_optimization` with its optional
  `object_refs` filter of canonical `code:` references in
  `aoci-cognition-volumes-v1.txt`, and cross-reference that intent from
  `aoci-database-cognition-authoring-v1.txt`, where it never applies to
  Database assessment. `project` and `meta` each deliver Root + Meta, no MCP
  tool is added, and ordinary no-argument Maintain is unchanged.
- Renumber the first-section items of the `aoci_rules` runtime-rules contract
  from `5.`-`8.` to `4a.`-`4d.` and prefix the `en-US` section headings with
  `Section `, so an item number no longer collides with the deliberate global
  `5.`-`18.` sequence of the later sections or with a section number. Item
  bodies stay byte-identical in both official locales.
- Stop the `aoci cognition` and `aoci database` group help from claiming
  read-only behavior neither group has: `cli.short.cognition` now names
  governed Apply workflows next to layout planning, since the group carries
  `aoci cognition bootstrap apply` and `aoci cognition onboard apply`, and
  `cli.short.database` scopes its read-only claim to database access, since
  those workflows write local Schema Evidence and advance the evidence
  Baseline. Both official locales change together; no command, flag, or
  runtime behavior changes.
- Correct the Git claim in `docs/install.md` and `docs/supply-chain.md`: the
  binary starts and non-Git directories are scanned without it, but Safe
  Inventory invokes the host `git` executable in any root holding `.git` for
  tracked and ignored authority and fails closed with
  `safe_inventory_git_unavailable` when that executable is absent. GitHub CLI,
  Cosign, Go, and SBOM readers remain verification-only with no runtime
  dependency.
- Document that the host configuration written by `aoci init --agent <name>`
  (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml`,
  `opencode.json`) embeds machine-bound absolute paths and belongs in
  `.gitignore`, and add a moved-binary-or-repository troubleshooting entry:
  the Claude and Codex installers detect an existing entry by key presence,
  so re-running `init` keeps the stale paths and `aoci doctor` still reports
  those integrations as installed while the server fails to start, whereas
  OpenCode fails closed on an `mcp.aoci` conflict; recovery is to remove the
  stale `mcpServers.aoci`, `[mcp_servers.aoci]`, `mcp.aoci`, and `PreToolUse`
  entries and re-run `init` from the new location.
- Scope the Windows Host-Agent guide to the layout it describes, marking its
  Entries/Header/Curation Stage sections Legacy, routing Volume-first
  repositories to the live Guide with ordinary no-argument `aoci_maintain` and
  `aoci_update_entry`, replacing the old `aoci_overview` size-threshold
  fallback with the current `continuation_required` chunked delivery, and
  recording the evidence-driven automatic replan, Resume, and Rollback
  closures for a `stopped` write. The "F length is never machine-blocked" rule
  now covers Legacy v1 Entries only, because FRAS v2 hard-limits a Volumes v1
  object's `F` to 160 runes.
- Add English renderings of three Chinese-only documents:
  `docs/contract-authority.md`, `spec/public/s-field-discipline.en.txt`, and
  `docs/windows-host-agent.en.md`, reachable from `AGENTS.md`,
  `spec/public/README.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, and a new pointer in
  `docs/windows-host-agent.md`. The Chinese files remain the normative
  originals; the renderings carry no machine-scanned declaration and open no
  second rule authority.
- Expand both public READMEs with the Volume-first layout, the three-stage
  workflow, cross-Agent and cross-session reuse of one Whole-Index, and a
  verbatim excerpt of the starter tag dictionary with a worked reading of one
  compact tag; each repository's formal Meta remains authoritative.
- Build every gate and the signed release from the single `go.mod` toolchain
  directive, now `go1.26.6`, so release archives carry the same patched
  standard library that fast CI, full confidence, and the rehearsal verify.
- Preserve the nine MCP tool names and their stable identity, FRAS v2, and the
  existing Index and Baseline formats; every response change in this release
  is an additive field.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc4 is 2026-08-15.

## v0.1.0-rc3

- Add an explicit `cognition_optimization` intent to `aoci_maintain` so a user
  can ask the model to review already-aligned Code Entries without source
  drift, while keeping ordinary maintenance behavior unchanged.
- Select optimization candidates deterministically from current Entry cost and
  C-band budget facts, require complete Entry submissions, and preserve the
  rule that AOCI itself does not generate, truncate, or compress semantics.
- Keep unchanged optimization submissions free of formal Index or Baseline
  writes, and reuse the existing atomic update, Baseline, Managed Scope,
  Recovery, and checkpoint paths for replacements and retries.
- Fix explicit Volumes Code and all-scope maintenance routing without changing
  Legacy or Database Cognition boundaries.
- Improve the bilingual public README, release-first one-step installation
  guidance, and self-contained Release archive branding.
- Preserve the nine MCP tool names and their stable identity, FRAS v2, and the
  existing Index and Baseline formats.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc3 is 2026-08-10.

## v0.1.0-rc2

- Improve evidence-backed S-field authoring guidance for high-importance
  cognition objects while preserving `S:-` when no qualifying constraint exists.
- Prevent neighboring Entries from determining the current object's S field,
  and add bilingual authoring-contract and compatibility coverage.
- Make signed-package installation and verification links usable from Release
  archives, and clarify source-build versus signed-binary version identity.
- Preserve the existing public Specs, FRAS v2 machine contract, and nine-tool
  MCP surface.

The first public availability date for v0.1.0-rc2 is 2026-08-10.

## v0.1.0-rc1

- Establish the public AOCI-CODE CLI and MCP runtime under the canonical Go
  module `github.com/aoci-spec/aoci-code`.
- Preserve the `aoci` binary and the reviewed nine-tool MCP contract.
- Publish the public runtime contracts under `spec/public/`.
- Add public build, test, security, integration, and supply-chain guidance.
- Prepare the FSL-1.1-MIT legal assets for authorized public distribution.

v0.1.0-rc1 was first made publicly available on 2026-08-08.
